# Distribution Build System (DBS)

Documentation and software for building  linux distributions from
a given dist-git.

There are many ways of creating Linux distributions and it appears that
each distribution has its own "secret sauce" for bootstrapping and building
the base image and I don't like that.

This project is aimed to allow users to create Linux distributions from scratch
regardless of the package system.
